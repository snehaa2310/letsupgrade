There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript.

number for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by ±253.
bigint is for integer numbers of arbitrary length.
string for strings. A string may have zero or more characters, there’s no separate single-character type.
boolean for true/false.
null for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value null.
undefined for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value undefined.
object for more complex data structures.
symbol for unique identifiers.
The typeof operator allows us to see which type is stored in a variable.

Two forms: typeof x or typeof(x).
Returns a string with the name of the type, like "string".
For null returns "object" – this is an error in the language, it’s not actually an object.
